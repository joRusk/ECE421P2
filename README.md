## Questions to Answer
1. What does a red-black tree provide that cannot be accomplished with ordinary search trees?
2. Please add a command-line interface (function main) to your crate to allow users to test it.
3. Do you need to apply any kind of error handling in your system (e.g., panic macro, Option\<T>, Result\<T,E>, etc...)
4. What components do the Red-black tree and AVL tree have in common? Don't Repeat Yourself! Never, ever repeat yourself - a fundamental idea in programming.
5. How do we construct our design to "allow it to be efficiently and effectively extend"? For example, could your code be reused to build a 2-3-4 tree or B tree?
